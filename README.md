# Flying Helicopter

Flying Helicopter is our final project for the Augmented Reality course. It is an augmented reality game where players 
pilot a virtual helicopter around their environment using an Xbox controller and Microsoft Hololens. The helicopter can 
interact with various AR markers placed throughout the room, and also with the real world through spatial mapping. Flying
Helicopter is intended to be a simple and intuitive augmented reality game that demonstrates the features and capabilities
of augmented reality to its players.
